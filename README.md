## Coding Exercises No. 05

1. Create a new file called ```exercise_1.rb``` and fill in the following line:

```ruby
dictionary = { :one => "ichi", :two => "ni", :three => "san" }
```

Add a code so that it prints out the following:

```
San
```
**Note:** Thereâ€™s a method that upcases the first letter of a string. Consult the ruby String documenation or start googling for "```ruby string upcase first letter```"

2. There is a method on hashes that allows to check if a certain key is defined on the hash. Find said method by googling for "```ruby hash key defined```".

Experiment with said method in ```irb``` by creating a ruby hash example below 

```ruby
dictionary = { :one => "ichi", :two => "ni", :three => "san" }
```

then calling the method and passing keys like :one, :two, :three and :five.

**Tip:** Aside from using google, you can also consult the [ruby Hash documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Hash.html).
